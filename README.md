# A-Star Pathfinding Tools

This project is in very early stages, currently there is a working prototype for .NET 6 (C#).
It is primarily focused on a grid based layout. However I might implement a generic graph alternative along side it.

### Todo
- Weight Smoothing (Currently being developed)
- Path Smoothing
- Unity Integration
  - Scanning Scene
  - Motor Agents
- Grid Stitching

### Possible Features
- Jump Point Search (Tinkered with already, haven't got it working yet)
